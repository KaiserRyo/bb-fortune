Fortune! for BlackBerry 10 WebWorks
===================================

So what is this?
----------------
* This is an adaptation of [jquery.fortune](https://github.com/mbadran/jquery.fortune) for BlackBerry 10 WebWorks
* This uses [BlackBerry 10 WebWorks](https://github.com/blackberry/BB10-WebWorks-Framework), [bbUI.js](https://github.com/blackberry/bbUI.js/), and [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)

Okay, now what?
---------------
* If you're familiar with Ripple and the BlackBerry WebWorks SDK, this is 100% ready for packaging and deploying.
* This will also happily load on your desktop or mobile browser of choice!
* The fortunes were mostly written by me, but if you'd like to make an addition, please do make a pull request!
