Fortune! for BlackBerry 10 WebWorks
===================================

So what is this?
----------------
* This is an adaptation of jquery.fortune (http://mbadran.github.com/jquery.fortune/) for BlackBerry 10 WebWorks
* This uses BlackBerry 10 WebWorks (https://github.com/blackberry/BB10-WebWorks-Framework), Twitter Bootstrap (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/), and jQuery (http://jquery.com/)
* The background used is from Subtle Patterns (http://subtlepatterns.com/) (https://github.com/subtlepatterns/SubtlePatterns)

Okay, now what?
---------------
* If you're familiar with Ripple and the BlackBerry WebWorks SDK, this is 100% ready for packaging and deploying.
* This will also happily load on your desktop or mobile browser of choice!
* The fortunes were mostly written by me, but if you'd like to make an addition, please do make a pull request!
